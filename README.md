# law-summary

## Overall description ##
NLP project to summarize laws.
We first apply this project on french laws, accesible from the website https://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/documents/liste/(type)/index-promulgations.

## Project description ##
We first scrap the website to access each law, and to access to its raw text, which can contain dozens to thousands of words.
Then we use a LLM to sum up each law.
